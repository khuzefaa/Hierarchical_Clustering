# Hierarchical_Clustering
a comprehensive tutorial on Hierarchical Clustering, focusing on the Agglomerative approach. It covers the intuition behind hierarchical clustering, its mathematical foundation, and the step-by-step process of Agglomerative Clustering.
# Hierarchical Clustering Tutorial

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (`Hierarchical_Clustering_Tutorial_2025.ipynb`) provides an in-depth tutorial on **Hierarchical Clustering**, with a focus on the Agglomerative Clustering approach. It is designed for learners and practitioners interested in understanding hierarchical clustering, its mathematical foundations, and its implementation in Python.

## Contents
- **Introduction**: Explains the intuition behind hierarchical clustering, including Agglomerative (bottom-up) and Divisive (top-down) methods.
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Details distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean) and linkage criteria (Ward, Single, Complete, Average) used in clustering.
- **Agglomerative Clustering Steps**: Outlines the step-by-step process of building a dendrogram and merging clusters.
- **Linkage Methods**: Describes the four common linkage strategies (Ward, Single, Complete, Average) with their goals, characteristics, and a summary table.
- **Python Implementation**:
  - Generates a synthetic dataset using `sklearn.datasets.make_blobs`.
  - Visualizes the dataset using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
  - Applies hierarchical clustering and evaluates performance using a confusion matrix on the Iris dataset.
- **Summary**: Highlights key takeaways, including the flexibility of not needing to predefine the number of clusters and the use of dendrograms for cluster selection.

## Prerequisites
